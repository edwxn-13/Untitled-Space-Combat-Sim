# Basic Training 

Dogfighting

The aim of dogfighting is to get behind your opponent where you can attack from. You can do this by using any variety of manoeuvres. 

While manoeuvring it is encouraged to slow down your craft to make attacks more sudden and harder for the enemy to track.

While engaged in combat you must be aware of your Shield level and Armour level. 
Shields regenerate, armour does not. When you have low shields, manoeuvre around the astroids for cover as you recharge.

When using your lasers, ensure they do not overheat. This will result in you having to wait for them to cool down and will leave you exposed on the battlefield.

Use R to look around and re-acquire targets that may have evaded you. Combined with your ships tracking features, no target can stay hidden or under your radar.

Target Lock 

Press T to iterate through targets. 
When a target is selected, a white square appears around the target. 
In order to acquire a missile lock. Ensure your reticle is placed  within the bounds of this square. Missiles are very effective, but only have a short range. Be sure to close the distance with your enemy before use.
